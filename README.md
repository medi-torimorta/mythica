# Mythica

This mod adds a new dimension, "Mythica" to the game.

The Mythica Dimension is a copy of the Overworld, and is intended for use in ModPacks.

This Mod adds 1 unobtainable item, the Mythic powder.

By default, right-clicking inside a portal frame made of reinforced deepslate, like those generated in Ancient Cities will spawn a portal to the Mythica Dimension.

## Configuration
It is recommended to add a recipe or a loot table for the Mythic powder via Datapacks.

The tag `#mythica:portal_frame_blocks` defines the blocks usable for portal frames,
and `#mythica:portal_replaceable` the blocks that can be replaced when a portal is generated inside the frame.

Use the config option to set the blocks used when an exit portal is generated. 

## Integration
Create:

The Mythica Portal works with Create trains, allowing the rails to connect through the portal and the train to pass through.
