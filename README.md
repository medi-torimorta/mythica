### Now Compatible with Terrablender Biomes!  
Biomes added by Terrablender are copied to Mythica by default, but can be set to be ignored, or removed from the overworld in favor of mythica.

## Overview
This mod adds a new dimension, "Mythica" to the game.  
The Mythica Dimension is a copy of the Overworld, and is intended for use in ModPacks.  
This Mod adds 1 item, the Mythic powder.  
By default, right-clicking inside a portal frame made of reinforced deepslate, like those generated in Ancient Cities will spawn a portal to the Mythica Dimension.  
The Mythic powder is unobtainable by default.  

## Configuration
It is recommended to add a recipe or a loot table to obtain the Mythic powder via Datapacks.  
The tag `#mythica:portal_frame_blocks` defines the blocks usable for portal frames,  
and `#mythica:portal_replaceable` the blocks that can be replaced when a portal is generated inside the frame.  
Use the config option to set the blocks used when an exit portal is generated.  
Terrablender-added overworld biomes can be set to copied to Mythica, ignored, or added to mythica and removed from the overworld.  
Copied biomes can be blacklisted in a per-mod basis.  

## Integration
# Create:
The Mythica Portal works with Create trains, allowing the rails to connect through the portal and the train to pass through.  
# TerraBlender:
Allows for copying/transferring TerraBlender-added biomes from the Overworld to Mythica.
