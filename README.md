# Mythica
=======

This mod adds a new dimension, "Mythica" to the game.
The Mythica Dimension is a copy of the Overworld, and is intended for use in ModPacks.
This Mod adds 1 item, the Mythic powder.
By default, right-clicking inside a portal frame made of reinforced deepslate, like those generated in Ancient Cities will spawn a portal to the Mythica Dimension.
The Mythic powder is unobtainable by default.

## Configuration
It is recommended to add a recipe or a loot table to obtain the Mythic powder via Datapacks.
The tag `#mythica:portal_frame_blocks` defines the blocks usable for portal frames,
and `#mythica:portal_replaceable` the blocks that can be replaced when a portal is generated inside the frame.
Use the config option to set the blocks used when an exit portal is generated.
